#README - Todo Testbed

##Purpose
This repo is intended as a testbed for new features on a simple 'TODO' app. It is based on a clone of one created during the @generalassembly 'Web Development Immersive' course I completed in March.

##Feature Added
- Created date for each todo
- Due date for each todo

##Features to be completed
- Completed date for each todo - This date will be added to the todo when the 'archive' checkbox is ticked. It must also be rest to null in the event that the todo is taken from the 'archive' section.
- Improve layout around each todo
