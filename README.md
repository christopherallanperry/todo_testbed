# README - Todo Testbed

## Purpose
This repo is intended as a testbed for new features on a simple AngularJS 'TODO' app. It is based on a clone of one created during the @generalassembly 'Web Development Immersive' course I completed in March.

## Features added
- Created date for each todo (in both remaining and archive sections)
- Due date for each todo (in both remaining and archive sections)

## Features to be completed
- Completed date for each todo - This date will be added to the todo when the 'archive' checkbox is ticked. It must also be rest to null in the event that the todo is taken from the 'archive' section.
- Improve layout around each todo
